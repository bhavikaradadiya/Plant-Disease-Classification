# Plant-Disease-Classification
This repository presents a deep learning–based computer vision project for automated plant disease diagnosis using Convolutional Neural Networks  and transfer learning with ResNet-50. The work demonstrates how modern AI methods can be applied to improve agricultural productivity, reduce manual diagnosis time, and enable early disease detection.
